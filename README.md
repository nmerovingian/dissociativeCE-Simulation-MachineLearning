All three methods mentioned in paper are included in this folder, including:

* Predict Constants.py Neural network for method A mentioned in paper. It can predict equilibrium constant and rate constant from voltammogram.
* Predict Voltammogram.py Neural network for method B mentioned in paper. It can predict voltammogram given equilibrium constant, rate costant and scan rate. 
* Predict Flux and Half Peak Potential.py Neural network for Method C mentioned in paper. It can predict half peak potential and peak flux from equilibrium constants and rate constants.
